# C CODE from previous psets in CS50 Translated to python

>I took an initiative to study cs50. From early weeks of the psets. the language has been in C. From Lecture 8 onwards there is a transition form C to python (my perceived juicy part).

The folder (side) contains other folder files, args and marioblocks have the files containing the python codes that translates previos C language code to now, Python.
