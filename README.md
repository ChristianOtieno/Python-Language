# Christian's python language escapades

In my quest to try 
---
_learn_,~~_delearn_~~, _understand_, and _use_ the **python language** 
---
in my quest to build the foundations that **I** needed for my _career_ in software development to take shape, 
>I realized that the Python programming language is a great tool to use when working with numbers and evaluating mathematical expressions. This quality can be utilized to make useful programs. 
This aligns well with what I have set my self to accomplish over the course of this journey.
