#When printing things in Python, we are supplying
#a text block that we want to be printed.
#Text in Python is considered a specific type of data called a string.
#A string, so named because they're a series of letters, numbers,
#or symbols connected in order â€” as if threaded together by string.
#Strings can be defined in different ways:

print ("Hello World!")
print ("Hello" + " World!")
print ('Hello Wolrd!')
