## Python Programming Task (Week 1)

_TASK 1:_
> Write a program which accepts a string as input to print "Yes", IF the string is "yes", "YES" or "Yes", otherwise print "No".
_Hint: Use input () to get the users input_

_TASK 2:_
>Write a program that contains a list, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the list a.

_TASK 3:_
>Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
*Extras:*
>If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.

_TASK 4:_
>With a given tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line.

_TASK 5:_
>Implement a program that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three. Do this without using the Python max () function!
>The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that Python normally takes care of for us.
