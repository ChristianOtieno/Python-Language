# Flask Blog Development

## Web App Part 1 - Getting Started

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to get started using the Flask framework. I got to install the necessary packages and get a basic Hello World Application running in our browser for a start.

## Web App Part 2 - Templates

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to use templates. Templates allow for reuse of sections of code over multiple routes and are great for serving up dynamic HTML pages. 

## Web App Part 3 - Forms and User Input

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to create forms and accept user input. I also learnt how to validate that user input and notify the user if the input was invalid.

## Web App Part 4 - Database with Flask-SQLAlchemy

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to create a database using Flask-SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is a great tool for working with databases because it allows us to interact with the database in an Object-Oriented manner, which is very intuitive once we get used to it. I learnt how to use a SQLite database to get me started for future understanding of more advanced databases like the Postgres database when I'd be deploying my future applications.

## Web App Part 5 - Package Structure

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to restructure the application into a package rather than running from a single module. This had major benefits in terms of importing modules across the application.

## Web App Part 6 - User Authentication

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to add users to the database. I learnt how to create an authentication system so that users can log in and log out of the application. With the help of @CoreyShafer I learnt how to use flask-bcrypt and flask-login extensions to help us with this.

## Web App Part 7 - User Account and Profile Picture

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was finishing up with my user account page so that a user can update their information. I also added the ability for a user to upload a profile picture. I learned how I can resize this image so that it couldn't take up much room on the server.

## Web App Part 8 - Create, Update, and Delete Posts

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I would learn how to add the ability for users to create, update, and delete posts. I also learned how I would prevent users from updating posts that don't belong to them.

## Web App Part 9 - Pagination

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to use pagination within the application. Pagination allows for only the loading a select number of items at a time so that in incase of this application, it doesn't get bogged down. I also learned how to display links to different pages at the bottom of the page so users can quickly navigate to the page of their choice.

## Web App Part 10 - Email and Password Reset

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to send emails to reset a user's password. Users would be able to fill out a form with their email and have a unique token sent to them, and if their token is verified then they will be able to create a new password. I used the flask-mail and itsdangerous packages to help with this.

## Web App Part 11 - Blueprints and Configuration

>In this Python Flask Tutorial, I was learning how to restructure my application to use blueprints. Blueprints allow for the splitting up of the application into more manageable sections. I also moved my configuration into its own file and created a configuration class. Lastly, I moved the creation of my application into its own function. This is called an Application Factory, and it allows to easily create multiple instances of the app with different configurations.
